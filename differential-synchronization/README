Eliom Collaborative Editor using Differential Synchronization
============

This repository showcase such an editor in a very simple fashion, using differential synchronization to keep the clients in sync.
This is mostly based on [this paper](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/) by Neil Fraser, and using his library [diff_match_patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/)

To compile this project you'll need Eliom (version 4.0 at least), a js_of_ocaml (version 2.3 at least).
You'll also need [Goji](https://github.com/klakplok/goji) and the [diff_match_patch goji binding](https://github.com/Engil/goji-lib-diff-match-patch).
